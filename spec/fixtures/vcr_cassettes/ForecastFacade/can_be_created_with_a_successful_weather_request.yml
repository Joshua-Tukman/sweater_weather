        DAY FOR PARTICULATES FROM 400 PM THURSDAY UNTIL 400 PM\nFRIDAY...\nThe Colorado
        Department of Public Health and Environment has\nissued the following...\nWHAT...Action
        Day for Particulates.\nWHERE...Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe,
        western\nAdams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties\nWHEN...400
        PM Thursday October 01 to 400 PM Friday October 02\nIMPACTS...Action Day for
        Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan
        area. Requests to limit\ndriving of non- ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel)
        are now in\neffect until at least 4 PM Friday, October 2, 2020.  Although
        fine\nparticulate concentrations have decreased significantly across\nmuch
        of the Front Range region on Thursday, areas of moderate to\nheavy smoke continue
        for locations in central and western Larimer\nCounty near the Cameron Peak
        wildfire. Additionally, the Cameron\nPeak and Mullen wildfires will likely
        intensify Thursday afternoon\nand increase smoke again across other parts
        of the Front Range\nregion Thursday evening through Friday morning, including
        the\nBoulder and Denver areas. Be prepared for sudden changes in air\nquality
        and please take action by reducing physical activity and\nspending time indoors
        as necessary. CDPHE requests that\nactivities, such as driving non-ZEV vehicles
        (i.e., gas or\ndiesel), be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring air\nquality.
        Additional air pollution in this region may directly\nworsen air quality or
        contribute to precursors which may also\nadversely affect air quality.  For
        Colorado air quality\nconditions, forecasts and advisories, visit:\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/airquality/colorado_summary.aspx\nHEALTH
        INFORMATION...If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your\nneighborhood you
        may want to remain indoors. This is especially\ntrue for those with heart
        disease, respiratory illnesses, the very\nyoung, and the elderly. Consider
        limiting outdoor activity when\nmoderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider
        relocating\ntemporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill.
        If\nvisibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood,\nsmoke
        has reached levels that are unhealthy."}]}'
